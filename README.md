# dsa-practice-cpp
This is a personal repository to improve my problem solving skills using Data Structures and Algorithms.

I give the commitment to practice and commit atleast 3 problems per day.

## Language
Though Java is most popular and mostly preferred for DSA, C++ was the first language I learnt in class 11 and made me fall in love with programming.

TL;DR - C++.

## Path
- I'll be following this roadmap 
https://whimsical.com/dsa-in-90-days-EmPkf5utoFGRMnRqJjM6YV
- Though not entirely, I'll be following the order.

## Repo Structure
- Every folder is named after the topics.
- It's readme will have the resources.
- Each folder will have the questions practiced with problem links in each of them.

## Environment Setup
- I'll be using Sublime Text Editor and this setup.

-I precompiled bits/stdc++.h header file for faster execution as mentioned in this link.

- For productivity purposes, I added a sample code snippet for C++ in Sublime.
### Steps followed
- Go to Tools > Developer > New Snippet
```
<snippet>
	<content><![CDATA[
		#include <bits/stdc++.h>
		using namespace std;

		int main() {

		return 0;
		}
]]></content>
	<!-- Optional: Set a tabTrigger to define how to trigger the snippet -->
	<tabTrigger>tempc++</tabTrigger>
	<!-- Optional: Set a scope to limit where the snippet will trigger -->
	<scope>source.c++</scope>
</snippet>

```
- Save the file with a name.snippet and use in any .cpp files.
